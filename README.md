# Music Player

This project is a simple and intuitive music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play, pause, and navigate through a list of songs, with a visually appealing interface that displays song information and progress.

## Features

- **Play and Pause**: Play or pause the current song with a single button.
- **Next and Previous**: Skip to the next or previous song in the playlist.
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of the current song's progress, which can be clicked to seek to different parts of the song.
- **Song Information**: Display the title and cover image of the currently playing song.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Contains a main container for the music player with sections for song information, audio controls, and navigation buttons.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Provides styling for the music player layout, including the progress bar and control buttons, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - **Load Songs**: Initially loads the song details (title, audio source, and cover image) based on the current index.
   - **Play/Pause**: Toggles between playing and pausing the current song.
   - **Navigation**: Allows navigation to the next or previous song and updates the UI accordingly.
   - **Progress Update**: Continuously updates the progress bar as the song plays and allows users to seek to different parts of the song by clicking on the progress bar.

2. **Click the play button** to start playing the song.
3. **Use the next and previous buttons** to navigate through the playlist.
